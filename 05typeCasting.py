# it is a process where data types can be changed forcefully or some time python itself convert it 
# when there are 2 diff types of data are added example one is int and other is float then python gives output in float because float has higher priority than int


#example
  

a= 43
b=21.54
print(a+b)#now in this the output will come into float 
# output is 64.53999999999

#example 2
c=2
d= 3.0
print(c+d)
#output is 5.0    (it can be 5 but there are 2 different types of data type so it converted the result in float which has higher priority)
