#for loop is use for repeating or printing again and agai 



# hair is a sample program

#name = "dev tiwari"
#for i in name 
#print(i)


#OUTPUT
#d
#e
#v 
# 
#t
#i

#i







# WE CAN ALSO TREAT WITH  ELEMENTS 



#colour = ["red", "green", "blue", "black"]
#for x in colour:
 #   print(x)
#      for i in x:
 #       print(i)



#OUTPUT
#red

#n
#blue
#b
#l

#a
#c
#k





# FOR PRINTING MULTIPLE TIMES


#for k in range(5):  
#   print(k)


#OUTPUT

#0
#1
#2
#3
#4










# EXAMPLE 2



#for k in range(1,11):
#    print(k)


#OUTPUT
#1
#2
#3
#4
#5
#6
#7
#8
#9
#10





#step  in /inside range


for k in range (1,20,4):#the num 3 use inside the range function is for skiping the value in n-1 form so i i have written 3 it willl treat as n-1 which is 3-1 = 2 so it will ski 2 values 

    print (k)


#output
#1
#5
#9
#13
#17
