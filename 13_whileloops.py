 # for printing first 5 num using while loop 


#i =0
#while(i<6):
#    print(i)
#    i=i+1


#output
#0
#1
#2
#3
#4
#5
 
 #example 2

 # decrementing 

count=5
while (count>0):
    print(count)
    count=count-1# we can also use else stamtemen in while loop it will work as if while loop didnt run for a single time it will go in else part

else:
    print("i am in else")


    #output
