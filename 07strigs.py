Whispers of the Horizon

Beneath the sky where dreams unfold,
A tale of hope is softly told.
The sun dips low, the stars take flight,
Painting the world in velvet light.

Through shifting winds, the rivers flow,
Carving paths where life will grow.
In every shadow, a spark will gleam,
The world awakens to chase a dream.''')
# this is the key for taking multi line string





# IF WE HAVE TO TAKE ("") OR ('') INSIDE A STRING
# THERE ARE 2 WAYS 


#1st
#a=("this is the way"this is the" key")# now we have to give(\)before "" which are have to in the statement 
a=("this is the way\"this is the\" key")# now the code will not have any error and it will print the "" also 




#2nd method
# the type of commoas have to be printed so take the opposit commoa option for starting and ending
# like if single have to be printed then use doubble for starting and ending and visa versa
# example 1
hi= ("this is the end ' hold your breath and count to ten' ")  
# example 2

ben=('he is nice"but for some times"')





# WE CAN ADD 2 STRINGS 
# EXAMPLE
a = "dev"
b="tiwari"
print(a+b)
#output is devtiwari 

#example 2

print("my name is " + a )
# output is  ---  my name is dev




# WE CAN TAKE OUT THE DATA AT ANY INDEX 
# EXAMPLE
c= "dev tiwari"
print(c[0])
print(c[1])
print(c[2])
print(c[3])
print(c[4])
print(c[5])
print(c[6])
print(c[7])
print(c[8])
print(c[9])
#output is 
# d
# e
# v 

# t 
# i 
# w 
# a 
# r 
# i
